# WellbeingWidget Component

A responsive, interactive UI component built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Vite** that allows users to check in on their current emotional state.

The feeling set to the state will be logged to console which can further be consumed by API endpoints.

  fireEvent.click(button);
  expect(button).toHaveClass("bg-[#e2f1ffb3]");
